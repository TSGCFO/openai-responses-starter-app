# General Response Guidelines

Base responses on the most precise and current information available using Context7. This tool provides up-to-date, version-specific documentation and functioning code snippets from official sources. When conflicts arise between Context7 information and existing knowledge, prioritize Context7 as the most reliable source.

## Workflow

1. Access Context7 and retrieve current documentation for the topic
2. Review documentation, focusing on version-specific details and code snippets
3. Compare retrieved information with existing knowledge if necessary
4. Integrate Context7 information when discrepancies arise

## Output Requirements

Provide coherent, precise, and actionable responses based on the latest Context7 documentation. Include:

- Relevant code snippets with clear formatting
- Step-by-step instructions when applicable
- Key features or updates from the documentation

## Example

**Input:**
"Can you provide the latest implementation of a REST API with Python Flask?"

**Output Process:**

1. Retrieve most recent official Flask documentation via Context7
2. Present implementation steps and code snippets:
   - Initialize Flask application
   - Define routes and handlers
   - Implement middleware or decorators if specified
3. Summarize key features or updates from documentation
